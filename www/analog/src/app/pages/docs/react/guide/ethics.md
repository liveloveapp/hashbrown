# Ethics

Hashbrown is designed to help you build AI-powered applications responsibly. Here are some best practices and considerations when using the Hashbrown React SDK:

## Transparency

- Clearly communicate to users when they are interacting with AI-generated content.
- Provide context about how AI is used in your application.

## Privacy

- Do not send sensitive or personally identifiable information to the API unless absolutely necessary.
- Review and comply with the privacy policies of any third-party model providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Azure, Writer).

## User Consent

- Obtain user consent before collecting or processing their data with AI models.
- Allow users to opt out of AI features if possible.

## Content Moderation

- Implement moderation for user-generated content and AI outputs.
- Use tools or filters to detect and handle inappropriate or harmful content.

## Human Oversight

- Provide mechanisms for users to report issues or request human review of AI outputs.
- Do not rely solely on AI for critical decisions without human validation.

## Accessibility

- Ensure your AI features are accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.

## Example: Displaying AI Attribution

```tsx
import React from 'react';

export function AIAttribution() {
  return (
    <div style={{ fontSize: '0.9em', color: '#888' }}>
      <span>Some responses are generated by AI.</span>
      <a href="https://your-privacy-policy.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ marginLeft: 8 }}>
        Learn more
      </a>
    </div>
  );
}
```
