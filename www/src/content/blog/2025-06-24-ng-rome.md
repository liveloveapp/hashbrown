## LiveLoveApp Presents Hashbrown

Mike and I (Brian) recently traveled to Rome, Italy to present Hashbrown - an open source framework for building generative user interfaces.
We were honored to be invited to speak at NG Rome 7th Edition, where we had the opportunity to share our work with the Angular community.
We presented Hashbrown as a framework for building generative user interfaces in Angular, showcasing its capabilities and how Angular developers can leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to build accessible and generative user interfaces.

## Feedback and Community

We received a lot of positive feedback from the community, with many attendees expressing their excitement about Hashbrown and its potential to revolutionize how we build user interfaces.
We are grateful to the NG Rome team for organizing such a fantastic event and to all the attendees who took the time to engage with us and share their thoughts.

## Watch the Talk

The video from the talk is coming soon, and we will share it here once it's available.
