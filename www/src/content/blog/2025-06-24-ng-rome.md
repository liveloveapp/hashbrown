## Launching in Rome

Mike and I traveled to Rome, Italy to launch Hashbrown on stage in one of the greatest cities on the planet.
We were honored to be invited to speak at NG Rome 7th Edition, where we had the opportunity to share our work with the Angular community.
We presented Hashbrown as a framework for building generative user interfaces in Angular, showcasing its capabilities and how Angular developers can leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to build accessible and generative user interfaces.
