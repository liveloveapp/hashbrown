They build from either the model out or the app layer down. But unless you start with the network layer and build up, you'll never be able to deliver realtime audio and video streams reliably. And perhaps even worse, you'll get core primitives wrong: interruption handling, conversation state management, asynchronous function calling.\r\n\r\nSean and Kwin agree on most things: old-school realtime systems people against the rest of the world. But they disagree on some important things, too, and will argue about those things live on stage. Do you need to give developers \"thick\" client-side realtime SDKs? Can you build truly great vendor neutral APIs? (You'll be surprised which of them argues which side, on that topic.)",

Our approach employs a dual retrieval strategy that harnesses both knowledge graphs and vector databases, enabling the generation of precise and contextually appropriate answers, thereby setting a new standard for LLMs in processing sophisticated data.",

But while language models can streamline individual tasks, true transformation comes from combining these capabilities into intelligent, autonomous systems‚ÄîAI agents.\r\n\r\nThis talk explores how to build and deploy foundation model-enabled agent systems that go beyond simple prompt chaining or chatbots. Drawing from real-world implementations and the latest research, it offers a clear and practical path to designing both single-agent and multi-agent systems capable of handling complex workflows with minimal oversight.\r\n\r\nAttendees will gain a deeper understanding of the core design principles behind agentic systems, the architectural trade-offs involved in orchestrating multiple agents, and the strategies required to develop tailored solutions that enhance efficiency and innovation. Whether just beginning or scaling up, participants will leave with actionable insights to navigate the rapidly evolving world of AI autonomy.",

    "Description": "Hi, I'm Dex. I've been hacking on AI agents for a while.\r\n\r\nI've tried every agent framework out there, from the plug-and-play crew/langchains to the \"minimalist\" smolagents of the world to the \"production grade\" langraph, griptape, etc.\r\n\r\nI've talked to a lot of really strong founders who are all building really impressive things with AI. Most of them are rolling the stack themselves. I don't see a lot of frameworks in production customer-facing agents.\r\n\r\nI've been surprised to find that most of the products out there billing themselves as \"AI Agents\" are not all that agentic. A lot of them are mostly deterministic code, with LLM steps sprinkled in at just the right points to make the experience truly magical.\r\n\r\nAgents, at least the good ones, don't follow the \"here's your prompt, here's a bag of tools, loop until you hit the goal\" pattern. Rather, they are comprised of mostly just software.\r\n\r\nSo, I set out to answer:\r\n\r\nWhat are the principles we can use to build LLM-powered software that is actually good enough to put in the hands of production customers?\r\n",

    "Title": "How to trust an agent with software delivery",
    "Description": "AI-powered agents promise faster, easier software delivery, but their unpredictable behavior often makes engineers hesitant to fully trust them with critical workflows. Sam Alba, Co-founder of Dagger (and previously co-creator of Docker), explains how teams can reliably integrate agents into their delivery pipelines by shifting how they structure and manage automation.\r\n\r\nHe'll share four practical strategies learned from real-world experience:\r\n\r\n1. Treat agents as workflow participants, not isolated tools.\r\nStop using agents as disconnected scripts or IDE plugins. Treating them as first-class parts of your delivery process simplifies your architecture, reduces hidden complexity, and makes agent outcomes more predictable.\r\n\r\n2. Use many small agents instead of one big one.\r\nJust as software evolved from monoliths to microservices, software delivery benefits from smaller, specialized agents with clearly defined responsibilities. Smaller agents are easier to understand, maintain, and integrate.\r\n\r\n3. Define clear environments‚Äîthe real lever for reliability.\r\nInstead of chasing perfect prompts or models, focus on clearly defining the tools, resources, and permissions around your agents. Precisely controlling their environments makes agents behave consistently and reliably.\r\n\r\n4. Design workflows for easy debugging and observability.\r\nAgents will sometimes fail unexpectedly. Sam will share simple, effective ways to build clear tracing and observability into your workflows from the start, making debugging quicker and less frustrating.\r\n\r\nYou'll leave with practical, immediately usable techniques that give you the confidence to trust AI agents in your software delivery pipelines.",

Data is \"not ready\".\r\nConversational analytics doesn't go beyond the analyst team because it's hard to verify if the generated queries are actually doing what they are supposed to.\r\nRAG based systems often fail to handle the breadth and depth of real world use-cases because it requires a prohibitive amount of preparation & maintenance of an underlying knowledge graph.\r\n\r\nAgentic AI systems need to hard-code specific workflows to work reliably and end up looking more like software engineering with LLM calls instead of delivering on the promise of truly agentic workflows.\r\n\r\nIn all of these failure modes, the common culprit is that the planning or reasoning done by the LLM fails to accurately capture the user's intent or the domain's context aka the lack of a well prepared semantic data layer.\r\n\r\nEnterprise data is silo-ed and vastly varying levels of quality and the perfect \"semantic layer\" and \"metadata\" is a moving target. New data is continuously being created and business definitions are rapidly changing and often entirely on-demand.\r\nIn this talk we'll share how you can build and maintain a semantic data layer that is maintained entirely by AI, and show (with live examples) how that dramatically improves reliability of the AI system that needs dynamic access to data.\r\nWe'll demonstrate how this sufficiently augments existing RAG, text-to-SQL and tool calling techniques and starts opening the door to reliable AI deployments.\r\n",

You‚Äôre losing money on every query.\r\n-Not high enough output quality? Your system can‚Äôt be used for that application.\r\n\r\nA model and the inference system around it form a ‚Äútoken factory‚Äù associated with a Pareto frontier‚Äî a curve representing the best possible trade-offs between cost, throughput, latency and quality, outside of which your LLM system cannot be applied successfully. \r\n\r\nOutside of the Pareto frontier?

    "Description": "YouTube recommendations drive nearly two-thirds of the platform's staggering 5 billion daily watch hours for 2 billion+ DAU. Traditionally powered by large embedding models (LEMs), we're undertaking a fundamental shift: rebuilding our recommendation stack using foundation models like Gemini. This talk dives into our engineering journey adapting general-purpose LLMs (Gemini) for the highly specialized, dynamic, and massive-scale task of YouTube recommendations.\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a critical first step: creating a \"language\" for YouTube videos. Learn how we developed 'SemanticID', a novel tokenization scheme that distills multimodal video features (text, audio, frames) into discrete tokens representable by an LLM. Our paper (Better Generalization with Semantic IDs: A Case Study in Ranking for Recommendations) is a landmark work in this space.  \r\n\r\nWe then adapt the base Gemini checkpoint to understand sequences of these video tokens alongside natural language, effectively teaching it the grammar of user watch behavior. A key insight: unlike static LLM training, YouTube's corpus evolves so rapidly (millions of new videos daily) that daily retraining is non-negotiable to maintain recommendation quality.\r\n\r\nNow we can prompt LRM with user history and context to generate personalized candidate recommendations, achieving the biggest engagement wins on YouTube in the last ~decade. \r\n\r\nThere‚Äôs a lot of attention on the LLM-led transformation of Search (with AI Overviews, Perplexity, ChatGPT-Search etc). However, across large consumer apps, it‚Äôs the recommendation systems & feeds that drive most consumer engagement, not just search (eg. YouTube recs drive 67% of WatchTime). This talk is about the LLM-led transformation of recommendations & feeds ‚Äì building a recommendation engine on top of Gemini.\r\n",

We will do a deep dive on the capabilities that the Gemini Live API combined with Pipecat unlock for devs with special focus on session management, turn detection, tool use (including async function calls), proactivity, multilinguality and integration with telephony and other infra. We will demo some of the more innovative capabilities. We will also talk through some customer use cases - especially how customers can use Pipecat to extend these realtime multimodal capabilities to client side applications such as customer support agents, gaming agents, tutoring agents etc. In addition, we also have an experimental version of the Live API powered by with Google's native audio offering that can be tried in an experimental capacity . This experimental model  can communicate with seamless, emotive, steerable, multilingual dialogue and enhances use cases where more natural voices can be a big differentiator. ",

    "Title": "Monetizing AI: From Zero to Profit",
    "Description": "As AI continues to transform industries, companies are faced with the critical challenge of effectively monetizing AI-driven products in a way that captures value, ensures customer adoption, and scales revenue sustainably. Unlike traditional SaaS models, AI-powered products have unique complexities - such as fluctuating usage patterns, variable compute costs, and evolving customer demands, making conventional pricing strategies unhelpful to the growth of an AI product-led startup.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Alvaro Morales, CEO and co-founder of Orb, will explore why the often overlooked monetization aspect of AI is critical for businesses. He‚Äôll share real-world examples and data to demonstrate how adaptive pricing models can drive cost savings, enhance customer experience, and reduce operational bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nAlvaro will lead a live demo, showcasing how engineers can simulate AI pricing strategies and subsequently integrate them with a simple plug-and-play solution. He‚Äôll also share how real-world revenue simulations enable companies to test and refine pricing before implementing ‚Äî reducing risk, boosting adoption, and unlocking new revenue streams. As a quick example, cloud software development platform Replit was looking to adopt a usage-based pricing model for a new product, but their existing billing system couldn't support the new model, and building a new billing system would delay the launch timeline. In order to get things done, they turned to Orb, which enabled them to make pricing changes up to the last minute. After the launch, Orb became the single source of truth for both Replit and its customers - providing usage alerts to notify Replit when users hit cost thresholds and provide insights into user spend and payment methods.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways: \r\nThe challenge of AI monetization ‚Äì Why traditional subscription-based SaaS pricing models don‚Äôt work for AI-powered products.\r\nPrecision pricing ‚Äì Exploring how usage-based, tiered, and hybrid pricing models can maximize revenue potential. \r\nRevenue simulation for AI pricing ‚Äì Leveraging real-time data to test, adjust and optimize pricing strategies.\r\nAvoiding common pricing pitfalls ‚Äì Identifying mistakes that can lead to revenue leakage and customer churn.\r\n\r\nThis session is designed for AI executives, product leaders, and engineering teams looking for actionable strategies to build adaptive, scalable pricing models that drive long-term growth and profitability.\r\n\r\n",

    "Description": "Agents are all the rage in 2025, and every single b2b SaaS startup/incumbent promises AI agents that can \"automate work\" in some way. \r\n\r\nBut how do you actually build this? The answer is two fold: \r\n1. really really good tools \r\n2. carefully tailored agent reasoning over these tools that range from assistant-to-automation based UXs.  \r\n\r\nThe main goal of this talk is to a practical overview of agent architectures that can automate real-world work, with a focus on document-centric tasks. Learn the core building blocks of best-in-class \"tools\" around processing, manipulating, and indexing/retrieving PDFs to Excel spreadsheets. Also learn the range of agent architectures suited for different tasks, from chat assistant-based UXs with high human-in-the-loop, to automation UXs that rely on encoding a business process into an end-to-end task solver. These architectures have to be generalizable but also highly accurate as agents get increasingly better at reasoning and code-writing. ",

Is \"eval\" the dataset for measuring the quality of your AI system? Is \"eval\" the measure, the metric of quality? Is \"eval\" the process of human annotation and scoring? Or is \"eval\" a third-party dataset run once to benchmark a model?\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this cacophony, this talk will provide an opinionated and principled perspective for what we actually mean when we say ‚Äúevaluation‚Äù, beyond the traditional for-loop-over-a-static dataset. \r\n\r\nIn particular, this perspective draws heavy inspiration from *fuzzing*, i.e. bombarding AI with simulated, unexpected user inputs to uncover corner cases at scale. This factors into sub-problems regarding:\r\n\r\n- Quality Metric. What is the actual criteria we, as humans, are using to determine if an AI system is producing good or bad responses? How do we elicit these criteria before the human SME can articulate them? How do we, as efficiently as possible, operationalize this criteria with an automated *Judge*?\r\n\r\n- Stimuli Generation. Given a metric, how do we know, with confidence, that an AI system is performing well with respect to the metric? What data is representative and sufficient for discovering all potential bugs of an AI system? And how do we generate this complex, diverse, faithful data at scale? \r\n\r\nWe will discuss in detail the philosophy, technology, and case studies behind both problems of Quality Metric and Stimuli Generation, and how they interact in concert.",

    "Description": "Shipping AI agents that are safe for production means solving some tough identity and authorization challenges that are not always obvious at the prototype stage. In practice, this comes down to a handful of deeply technical questions:\r\n- How do you make sure agents are only acting for the right user?\r\n- How do you prevent over-broad API access or data leaks?\r\n- How do you handle user approvals when there is no UI, or you need a human in the loop?\r\n- And how do you avoid the usual pain points like manual credential sharing, stale keys, or unpredictable scopes without writing a lot of brittle, custom code?\r\n\r\nThis talk digs into the real technical trade-offs behind building secure, user-aware AI agents. We will go beyond what to do and explain why, sharing the architectural decisions, open standards, and hard lessons learned from integrating OAuth, OIDC, RAR, and async authorization into agent-driven workflows.\r\n\r\nYou will see a hands-on demo using an open-source Node.js agent and open protocols, with a focus on practical integration and no magic. The session will show how these solutions have shaped our approach to identity in GenAI and where we see the field heading next.\r\n\r\nIf you are an engineer building AI apps that need real guardrails, not just a happy-path demo, we hope to leave you with some practical patterns, design rationale, and a clear view of the trade-offs for making your own agents production ready.",

    "Title": "CI in the Era of AI: From Unit Tests to Stochastic Evals",
    "Description": "Software engineers have long understood that high-quality code requires comprehensive automated testing. For decades, our industry has relied on deterministic tests with clear pass/fail outcomes to ensure reliability. \r\n\r\nHigh-quality software depends on automated testing. That's certainly true at Zed, where we're building a next-generation native IDE in Rust. Zed runs at 120 frames per second, but it would also crash once a second if we didn't maintain and run a comprehensive suite of unit tests on every change.\r\n\r\nBut what happens when AI enters the equation?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore how continuous integration evolves when working with AI components. \"Evals\" - parlance from the machine learning field - are fundamentally a continuation of the software testing tradition, but with a critical difference: they're inherently stochastic.\r\n\r\nZed's traditional CI goes to extreme lengths to eliminate non-determinism, as nobody likes having their pull requests blocked by flaky builds. We've even fully simulated network interactions with a deterministic random scheduler. AI components, however, forced us to confront a fundamental paradigm shift‚Äîuncertainty isn't a bug but an intrinsic feature of these systems, compelling us to embrace what we couldn't avoid.\r\n\r\nWe'll share our journey of reconceptualizing evals as \"stochastic unit tests\" - still verifying system behavior, but without binary pass/fail grades.\r\n\r\nWe'll discuss practical approaches to:\r\n- Thoughtfully building test suites for AI components\r\n- Shifting from red/green outcomes to \"shades of gray\"\r\n- Replacing build gates with trend analysis and performance monitoring\r\n- Maintaining engineering confidence despite statistical variance\r\n\r\nWhether you're incorporating AI into existing systems or building new AI-powered tools, this talk will provide practical insights into maintaining quality when determinism gives way to probability.",
